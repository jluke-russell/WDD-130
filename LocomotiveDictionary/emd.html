            <h2>Electro-Motive Division General Purpose Series</h2>
            <p>
              The EMD GP (General Purpose) Locomotives are four axle road
              switchers that saw a production run from 1949 to 2001. The Geeps
              as they are lovingly refered to by railfans are typically seen
              working in switching yards and providing power on local frieghts.
              Geeps are identified by their short car body and four axle trucks.
              GP units that feature orange strobe lights on the cab roof mean
              that those locomotives can be remotely controlled.
            </p>

            <p>
              The GP38-2 is one of the most popular and successful of the
              General Purpose series. identified by having 2 radiator fans on
              the back and one up front, the GP38-2 was produced between 1972 to
              1986 and features a 2,000 horsepower engine.
            </p>

            <p>
              The GP38-3 features EMD's new box-cab commonly refered to by
              railfans as the "sponge bob" cab. This is the only visual
              difference between the -2 and -3 GP38's.
            </p>

            <p>
              The GP40-2 was in production from 1972 to 1986, and is rated at
              3000 horsepower. It is distingushed from its smaller brother the
              GP38 by its three radiator fans on the rear of the locomotive.

              Just like the GP38-3, the GP40-3 also features the new EMD box-cab
              and more advanced electronics.

            <h2>Electro-Motive Division Special Duty Series</h2>
            <p>
              The Electro-Motive Division Special Duty (SD) series was EMD's
              main road power for frieght trains for the longest time. The SD's
              are differentiated from the GP's by having 6 axle trucks and
              longer car body. The SD's have been overshadowed by the General
              Electric locomotives in recent times, but have since made a small
              comeback. CSX carries two classes of SD series locomotives, the
              SD40 and the SD70 series.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/SD40-2.jpg" alt="SD40-2" />
            <p>
              The SD40-2 is a rebuild version of the venerable SD40 locomotive.
              The SD40-2 features advanced electronics systems and also remote
              control for yard work. You will sometimes see the old SD40's on
              local frieghts and sometimes trailing on road frieghts. These
              units have been in service since the 70's and with many upgrades
              are still going strong.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/SD40-3.jpg" alt="SD40-3" />
            <p>
              The EMD SD40-3 is identical to the -2 with the exception of the -3
              having the EMD box-cab. These new cabs were introduced in 2010 and
              feature better crash ratings, new heating and air-conditioning
              systems, a new control stand, including visual displays, a more
              modern braking controller, and modernized starting systems. Both
              SD40 variants have 3000 horsepower.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/SD70MAC.JPG" alt="SD70MAC" />
            <p>
              The EMD SD70MAC is the AC (alternating current) traction motor
              version of the SD70M both built in 1992. The SD70MAC is the direct
              competition to the General Electric Dash9-44CW. The SD70MAC has
              4000 horsepower and can still be seen pulling trains to this day.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/SD70MACflared.jpg" alt="SD70MAC Flared" />
            <p>
              The EMD SD70MAC with the flared radiators on the longhood, known
              as the "Flared MAC" by railfans, are suped-up versions of the
              standard SD70MAC with 4300 horsepower and AC traction motors. The
              flared MACs are also direct competitors with the GE Dash9-44CW.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/ST70ACe.JPG" alt="ST70ACe" />
            <p>
              The EMD SD70ACe known to CSX as the ST70AH, is CSX's answer to the
              GE Evolution series. The ACe as it's known, meets the new tier
              four emmission standards set by the EPA and is one of the cleanest
              burning locomotives out there. The SD70ACe-T4 as it's officially
              known, was first produced in 2015 and has 4400 horsepower. The ACe
              has all new internal systems from the older MAC's on CSX's roster
              and is easily identifiable by its large flared radiator and cut
              nose style widecab.
