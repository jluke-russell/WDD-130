            <h2>General Electric Standard Series</h2>
            <p>
              The General Electric Standard or "Dash" series was their first
              major break into the modern desiel locomotive market. With launch
              customer Union Pacific, the GE Dash8-40CW became the basis of the
              most successful desiel-electric locomotive series to date.
            </p>

            <p>
              Built in the 80's the GE Dash8-40CW was GE's answer to EMD's SD60.
              Featuring 4000 horsepower, the Dash8 was CSX's workhorse until it
              was replaced by the more modern Dash9. CSX still holds onto a few
              of its old Dash8's in reserve; if you're lucky, you may get to see
              one of these trusty locomotives in action.
            </p>

            <p>
              For CSX, the GE Dash9-44CW resembled the Dash8-40CW physically but
              had improved electronics and increased horsepower to 4400
              horsepower. Unlike most class one railroads, CSX chose to keep the
              original Dash8 trucks instead of GE's new Hi-ad trucks.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/CM44AC.jpg" alt="AC44CW" />
            <p>
              The AC44CW, known to CSX as the CM44AC, is distingushed from the
              GEVOs by its shorter radiator, like that on the C44-9W and
              C40-8W's. The CM44AC featured new alternating current (AC)
              traction motors, 4400 horsepower, and a new style of trucks that
              remained constant with the ES series of GEVO's.

            <h2>General Electric Evolution Series</h2>
            <p>
              GEVO stands for GE Evolution Series, representing General
              Electric's move into the future and meeting new emmission
              standards.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/ES40DC.jpg" alt="ES40DC" />
            <p>
              The ES40DC and the ES44DC look the same and feature direct current
              (DC) traction motors. The only difference is that the ES40DC has
              4000hp while its counterpart has 4400hp hence the 40 and 44
              respectively in the locomotive designations. The ES40DC is
              essentally an upgraded version of the Dash9-40CW with better
              electronics.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/GevoDPU.PNG" alt="ES44DC" />
            <p>
              The ES44DC, like the ES40DC is distingushable from the other
              GEVO's by its Hi-ad trucks. The ES44DC is the upgraded version of
              the Dash9-44CW.
            </p>

            <img src="./images/Gevo2.PNG" alt="ES44AH" />
            <p>
              The ES44AH more commonly known as the ES44AC is the direct
              replacement for the CM44AC. The main difference between the ES44AH
              and the CM44AC is the longer radiator featured on the GEVO series.

            <p>
              The ET44AH is the replacement for the ES44AH and is GE's newest
              diesel-electric locomotive available for purchace. THe ET44AH's do
              not have the second slant on the radiator as seen on the the
              ES44AH GEVOs do, but the do feature the Hi-ad trucks of the older
              ES40DC and ES44DC locomotives.
