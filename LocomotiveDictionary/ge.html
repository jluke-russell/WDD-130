            <h2>General Electric Standard Series</h2>
            <p>
              The General Electric Standard or "Dash" series was their first
              major break into the modern desiel locomotive market. With launch
              customer Union Pacific, the GE Dash8-40CW became the basis of the
              most successful desiel-electric locomotive series to date.
            </p>
            <h2>Dash8-40CW</h2>
            <img class="image" src="./images/Dash8-40CW.jpg" alt="Dash8-40CW" />
            <p>
              Built in the 80's the GE Dash8-40CW was GE's answer to EMD's SD60.
              The Dash8 boasts 4000 horsepower with direct current traction
              motors, the Dash8 was CSX's workhorse until it was replaced by the
              more modern Dash9 and the later GEVO series of locomotives. CSX
              still holds a few of its old Dash8's in reserve; if you're lucky,
              you may get to see one of these trusty locomotives in action.
            </p>
            <h2>Dash9-44CW</h2>
            <img class="image" src="./images/Dash9-40CW.jpg" alt="Dash9-40CW" />
            <p>
              For CSX, the GE Dash9-44CW resembled the Dash8-40CW physically but
              had improved electronics and increased horsepower to 4400
              horsepower, though some retained the 4000 horsepower rating.
              Unlike most class one railroads, CSX chose to keep the original
              Dash8 trucks instead of GE's new Hi-ad trucks.
            </p>
            <h2>CM44AC or AC4400CW</h2>
            <img class="image" src="./images/CM44AC.jpg" alt="AC44CW" />
            <p>
              The AC4400CW, known to CSX as the CM44AC, is distingushed from the
              GEVOs by its shorter radiator, like that on the Dash9-44CW and
              Dash8-40CW's. The CM44AC featured new alternating current (AC)
              traction motors, 4400 horsepower, and a new style of trucks that
              remained constant with the ES series of GEVO's. These powerful
              locomotives were designed for CSX's long and heavy coal trains.

            <h2>General Electric Evolution Series</h2>
            <p>
              GEVO stands for GE Evolution Series, representing General
              Electric's move into the future and meeting the EPA's new
              emmission standards. To meet these new standard, the locomotive's
              radiator cover at the rear of the locomotive was lengthened to
              make room for a larger radiator. The GEVO's feature more effecient
              and clean burning engines.
            </p>
            <h2>ES40DC</h2>
            <img class="image" src="./images/ES40DC.jpg" alt="ES40DC" />
            <p>
              The ES40DC and the ES44DC look the same and feature direct current
              (DC) traction motors. The only difference is that the ES40DC has
              4000hp while its counterpart has 4400hp hence the 40 and 44
              respectively in the locomotive designations. The ES40DC is
              essentally an upgraded version of the Dash9-44CW with better
              electronics.
            </p>
            <h2>ES44DC</h2>
            <img class="image" src="./images/GevoDPU.PNG" alt="ES44DC" />
            <p>
              The ES44DC, like the ES40DC is distingushable from the other
              GEVO's by its Hi-ad trucks. The ES44DC is the upgraded version of
              the Dash9-44CW. These newer locomotives are also built for remote
              running as distributed power units known as DP units or DPU. DP
              units allow for better more efficient train handling. Having a
              locomotive in the center or rear of the train allows for the power
              to be applied in multiple places, and for the brakes to be more
              responsive.

            <p>
              The ES44AH more commonly known as the ES44AC is the direct
              replacement for the CM44AC. The main difference between the ES44AH
              and the CM44AC is the longer radiator featured on the GEVO series.
              These newer AC traction motor locomotives are still used for the
              long coal drags featured on the CSX, but they are versitile
              machines that are seen on all different types of trains.

            <h2>ET44AH</h2>
            <img class="image" src="./images/ET44AH.PNG" alt="ET44AH" />
            <p>
              The ET44AH is the replacement for the ES44AH and is GE's newest
              diesel-electric locomotive available for purchace. THe ET44AH's do
              not have the second slant on the radiator as seen on the the
              ES44AH GEVOs do, but the do feature the Hi-ad trucks of the older
              ES40DC and ES44DC locomotives.
