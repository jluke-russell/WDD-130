        <p>
          Here at Locomotive Dictionary pride ourselves with helping the novice
          railfan learn about CSX locomotive power. Our experience in the field
          has been invaluble to our company and will provide a good starting
          place for anyone.

          I first came up with the idea for Locomotive Dictionary when I began
          railfanning. I have always loved trains, and watching them. However, I
          did not know how to tell them apart, thus I searched for resources to
          help me, but I did not find anything comprehensive and simple enough
          for the novice railfan. Locomotive dictionary changes that.
        </p>

          Americaâ€™s rail network is the backbone of the transportation of heavy
          goods. These locomotives are one of the most important aspects of this
          network; without the power and reliability of these locomotives, the
          transportation of goods will grind to a halt, hurting the economy and
          the nation. We hope that Locomotive Dictionary will help you learn
          more about diesel-electric locomotives. We also hope that you can use
          the description of each locomotive to positively identify them on your
          next railfan adventure!
